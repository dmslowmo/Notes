====== Monday 27 Jun 2016 ======

[ ] Started refactoring Calculation
	[*] split calculation strategies into individual classes
	[*] CalcUTest passes
	[ ] but a lot of other unit tests failed (strange?)
		[ ] caused by my ActionValidator refactoring commit
		[ ] reverting that code fixed the unit tests
