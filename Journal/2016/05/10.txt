[ ] SDHL 2.0
	[ ] How does it invoke another rule which opens Walled Garden page
		[*] JAVA App SDHL Engine checks TR69 params periodically every 1 min
		[*] eg. WANEthernet status
		[*] If a no connection after 5 mins, then send alert via REST to SDHL Connection Server
			[*] Then TR69 params are updated accordingly
		[ ] In the mean time, **some module** that is watching the TR69 param will invoke the WallGarden
			[ ] need to study how sdhl_wall_garden.cpp works
			[ ] it is invoked from cust_verizon/components/bhr_librest/settings_wall_garden_handler.cpp
			[ ] but need to find the missing link between:
				[ ] TR69 param update and
				[ ] invoking Wall Garden, then
				[ ] redirecting using iptables to the wall garden page
	[ ] Define how we detect unable to route:
		[ ] ArpGatewayUnreachable (try it out)
		[ ] DNS failures? Ping? TKEcho failures?
		[ ] Document the theory of operation - when exactly this condition is detected
