====== Tuesday 24 May 2016 ======

[*] SDHL 2.0
	[*] How to create rules dynamically?
		[*] Currently, no example, but will do similar thing like in the 'migrate rule' class
[*] SDHL Java App
	[*] fixing unit tests
		[*] some need refactoring if want to be fixed, eg. ones that deal with JSON string creation from (unordered) HashMap: the test will fail everytime the order changed
	[*] moving build tool to Gradle	
		[*] low priority for now, but will work on it on the side and need to convince Bob that:
			[*] no download of dependencies needed (dependencies are checked in with the codes)
			[*] gives the same result as current build tool (Ant)
	[*] Codes are written in Java 1.5 !!!
		[*] perhaps due to Skelmir's limitation
		[*] can't do a lot of things, like <> notation not supported
