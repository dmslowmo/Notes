[ ] SDHL 2.0
	[ ] In the mean time, **some module** that is watching the TR69 param will invoke the WallGarden
		[ ] need to study how sdhl_wall_garden.cpp works
		[ ] it is invoked from cust_verizon/components/bhr_librest/settings_wall_garden_handler.cpp
		[ ] but need to find the missing link between:
			[ ] TR69 param update and
			[ ] invoking Wall Garden, then
			[ ] redirecting using iptables to the wall garden page
[ ] Define how we detect unable to route:
	[ ] ArpGatewayUnreachable (try it out)
	[ ] DNS failures? Ping? TKEcho failures?
	[ ] Document the theory of operation - when exactly this condition is detected
[ ] NEW! Study how file upload works in BHR
