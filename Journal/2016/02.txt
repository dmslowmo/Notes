====== February 2016 ======

22 February 2016

====== BHR4 issue: ======
1. Vineet reproduced the crash. Will start another round of testing with Veriwave after increasing Cortina's reserve memory to 4M from 2M
2. Daniel started observation on BHR4 memory since Friday morning 10AM. Started free memory at ~89MB
	* Ran 10M UDP echo test split among 25 UDP Clients ⇒ free memory dropped by 10MB. This test was performed 2x
	* Leaving BHR4 over the weekend, free memory was found at ~65MB or in other words dropped by 25MB since started on Friday
	* Started a 100M UDP echo test split among 25 Clients ⇒ so far dropped by another 10+MB
3. Plan for today:
	a. Vineet monitor the test with extended memory limit (see above)
	b. Daniel will try to bring free memory down to below 40MB, then try to upload (but not flash) a firmware to BHR4, see if it recovers the memory or crashes

UPDATE:
1. BHR4 still crashed with Cortina's memory limiter set to 4MB. Increasing it to 8MB and rerun the test (in-progress, by Vineet)
2. 100M UDP echo test with 25 clients still ongoing after 8 hours. Memory seems to stabilize at 46MB.
