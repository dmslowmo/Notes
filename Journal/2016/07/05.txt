[*] Merged CalculationParameters
[ ] New AlertMap matching type â€” wild-carded count
	[ ] https://greenwavesystems.atlassian.net/browse/BHR2X-157
	[ ] Desigin:
		[ ] Per-client alert for a particular stats, eg PHY rate
		[ ] when alert is raised, update raised-alert list
			[ ] since the polling interval is the same as calculation interval, it is expected that the list contain unique alerts
			[ ] alert, if raised, should occur every 5*n minutes, where n >= 1
		[ ] Poor Aggregate PHY rate (for eg)
			[ ] calculated every 5 minutes
			[ ] calculation: (no. of raised alerts)/(no. of possible alerts) * 100%
			[ ] then reset the count/list of raised alerts
			[ ] Action will be taken when alerts are raised for more than 50% of the clients
				[ ] Action could be resetting the connection, or just logging, etc
			[ ] Need 1 rule, but per-client Alert?
				[ ] NO, it is still 1 Rule object, 1 Alert object, but the rule per client follows a "template rule"
