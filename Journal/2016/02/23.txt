**Volunteer Project Review:**
__Google Iot Exploration__
1. Need to allocate more time per week, put in more dedicated and focussed effort
2. Hands-on to create a minimum POC demo
	a. Have a plan what we want to do
	b. As much as possible, use readily available components that other people have done and we just integrate them
	c. Divide the tasks into smaller parts, distribute among members if possible
3. Target to demo something in the next Review meeting in a month's time (4th Tuesday of every month)

__CoAP__
1. There may not be much interest in it, so don't put too much effort, ie:
	a. Plan for a simple demonstration eg client-server communication "hello World"
	b. Use readily available components in internet and integrate them
	c. Package the demo, if necessary into an zip or bin and attach it in wiki
	d. Document everything in wiki

TODO today:
[ ] Start copying Windows7 VM from shared drive to local drive
