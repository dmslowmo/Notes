====== Monday 14 Mar 2016 ======

[*] [[Redmine Issues:Closed:Browsable web directory]] what's the resolution?
	[*] seems cherokee configuration template file has been removed (is cherokee still used?)
		[*] cherokee has been replaced by lighttpd
	[*] build 1.4 from master and test for the issue
		[*] if doesn't happen, then no need to cherry-pick 1.3.2 patch
		[*] ~~else, need to find what web server is used and how to configure it~~
[ ] Other low-priority BHR4 tickets:
	[ ] Bandwidth test's TestByte > TotalBytes
	[*] DHCP issue
		[*] reassign to Ambarish for more info
[x] Setup Simplicity Studio Thread project
	[ ] can't do it without hardware, it seems
	[ ] without license, the code size is limited
	[ ] probably can only view codes
