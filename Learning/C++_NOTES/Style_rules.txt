====== Style rules ======
Created Monday 07 March 2016

**Guidelines**
* apply to new codes, leave the old codes alone, please

1. Prefer default parameters
	a. Provide default parameters, eg Holder(string s="", int n=0):name(s), number(n){};
2. Use **nullptr**
	a. you will still have some pointers in your application
	b. stop comparing or setting them to 0 and to NULL
		* nullptr is type-safe
		* **if (p)** still works as usual
			* it's a well known idiom
			* smart ptr has overload for bool
		* so don't use
			* p = NULL
			* if (p == 0)
			* **They are not type-safe!**
3. No magic numbers
	a. expressivity and readability
	b. instead of raw integer, use
		a. enum
		b. const
		c. NOT macros â‡’ it can be redefined at different point in the codes, accidentally or deliberately
4. Use const from the start
	a. expressivity and readability
		1. enough to read header file
		2. optimization and performance
	b. Chasing const-correctness is hard
		a. easy to follow by/communicate to others
		b. don't do it after codes are written and tested
	c. make it a natural habit
		a. in design and in header file
5. Treat warnings as errors
	a. highly recommended
	b. individual warnings can be suppressed with a pragma (if you want to)
		* eg. #pragma warning(...) 
	c. good practice because:
		a. exposes errors of thought
		b. warns where it might be wrong
