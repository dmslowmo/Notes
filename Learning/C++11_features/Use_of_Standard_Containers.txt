====== Use of Standard Containers ======
Created Monday 29 February 2016

* No need to write our own
* No need to take care of memory management manually
* No need to handle special cases
* Type safety
* Expressivity â‡’ ppl know what it is/does

* Practical advice: if you wonder what to use:
	* **Use **[[+vector|Vector]]
	* Grows itself when you add new element
	* Can traverse with an iterator or random access with []
	* Decent performance
	* Cleans up after itself
		* even when there is exception
		* eg. try { //some vector creation } catch (std::exception& ex) { }
		* in this example, we didn't do anything to clean up the memory allocated for the vector in the catch block, and we didn't need to

* Use of standard algorithm eg. std::begin(v) and std::end(v), std:max_element(v1, v2) is useful
	* it allows you to switch what container (ie. v) you use
	* v can even be a c-style array

* write your code to make switching containers easy:
	* auto
	* begin() and end()
	* Algorithms

* Containers:
	* [[+vector|vector]], [[+list|list]], map
	* queue, dequeue
