====== 00 SELinux Labels ======
Created Monday 04 April 2016

===== SELinux is all about labelling =====
* User:Role:Type:Level
* Type â†’ policy type

===== Type Enforcement (TE) =====
* Objects with the same security requirements grouped under the same **Type**
* Those objects can interract with each other
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
ps -eZ | grep control #shows the label of processes or domain
}}}

* **unconfined_t** domain is for processes that are not regulated by any policy (if SELinux not enabled, all processes will be in this domain)
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
seinfo -t | less # to see the info of domains
seinfor -u # to see the SELinux users
semanage login -l # to see the mapping between the login name to SELinux User
seinfo -r # to see the roles
}}}
