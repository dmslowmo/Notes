====== 4 ICMPv6 ======
Created Tuesday 29 March 2016

* used to report errors and messages
* IPv6 is not possible to operate wihtout it
* **Error** and **Informational**
* more info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol_version_6#Types_of_ICMPv6_messages

===== Header format: =====

	* Type: 8 bits
	* Code: 8 bits
	* Checksum: 16 bits
	* Message body: variable

===== For Errors: =====

	* problem delivering
	* problem forwarding
	* uses type and code combinations
	* simple error reporting method
	* Error messages code: 0 - 127
		* eg. Destination Unreachable (ICMPv6 type 1)
			* no route to dest (code 0)
			* address unreachable (code 3)
			* port unreachable (code 4)
		* packet too big (type 2) (code 0)
		* time exceeded (type 3)
			* hop limit exceeded in transit (code 0)
		* parameter problem (type 4)

===== For informational =====

	* for diagnostics and troubleshooting
	* neighbor discovery
	* MLD (multicast listeners discovery)
	* tools include ping and traceroute
	* code: 128 - 255
		* Echo Request (type 128)
		* echo reply (129)
		* Neighbor/Multicast discovery

===== ICMPv6 Path MTU Discovery Requirements. Required: =====

	* Type 2, Code 0 → Packet too big
	* Type 135, code 0 → Neighbor solicitation
	* Type 136, code 0 → neighbor Advertisement

===== Path MTU Discovery. Flow: =====

	* the host sends traffic at the asumed MTU size or the local LAN infterface
	* Router forwarding interface has smaller MTU
	* Router send ICMPv6 packaet too big message
	* Host sends traffic again with MTU size specified in the ICMPv6 Packet Too Big message from the router
	* Router then forwards the packet since the MTU size matches for that link

===== How would you use ICMPv6 : =====

	* primarily with tools
	* ping or ping6
	* tracert or traceroute
	* pathmtu

==== In Windows: ====

	* ping and tracert are the same command
	* 3rd party tools may be different
	* does not differentiate between v4 and v6 commands
	* use //-6// to specify that you want strictly AAAA record type DNS name resolve (IPv6)
		* //ping -6//
		* //mtupath -6//

==== In Linux ====

	* ping6 instead of ping
	* traceroute has the //-6// option
	* third party tools vary
	* //ndisc6 (neighbor discovery tool)//
		* need to specify the interface eg eth0
