* used to capture network traffic on a particular interface(s)
* How to install and use:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
$ sudo apt-get install wireshark             #install wireshark on Ubuntu
$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common     #need this step, not sure why
$ sudo usermod -a -G wireshark $USER         #add your username to wireshark group
#$ sudo reboot                                #reboot your system or simply exit the console
$ exit
}}}

* see https://ask.wireshark.org/questions/7523/ubuntu-machine-no-interfaces-listed
* Start wireshark as root with sudo (ignore the warning)
* Select the interface you want to monitor eg. eth0


===== tcpdump =====
* useful links:
	* https://danielmiessler.com/study/tcpdump/
	* http://www.rationallyparanoid.com/articles/tcpdump.html
* Quick tips:
	* to capture IPv6 packet, add //ip6// flag
	* unfortunately, we can only filter ICMP packets (IPv4), but not ICMPv6 packets, we may still get other packets other than ICMPv6
	* quick example: //tcpdump -ieth0 -n -v ip6//
