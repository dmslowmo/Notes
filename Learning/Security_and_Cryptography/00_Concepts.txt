Created Monday 28 March 2016


* Cryptography â€” the practice and study of hiding information

===== Symmetric vs Asymmetric =====
	* Symmetric: uses the **same** key to encrypt and decrypt
		* often reffered to as shared key or secret key encryption
		* key management is biggest concern
			* both parties ust know the secret key
			* difficult to prove identitiy
		* symmetric key is faster hkan asymmetric
	* Asymmetric: encryption uses a two-key system (public/private key)
		* the public an dprivate keys are mathematically linked
		* key pair is used: one of encryptioin and the other for decryption
			* enc with public, dec with private
			* or vice versa

===== Session keys =====
	* single0use symmetric key used for encrypting all communication in one comm session
		* symm encry is faster than asymm encry
		* assymm keys can be used to encrypt the sesion keys

===== in-band vs out-of-band key exchange =====
	* out of band:
		* not sent over network
		* needs to be delivered via traditional/manual means
	* in band:
		* done over the network as comm sesisio is established
		* created in real time then typically discarded once the session is over

===== Fundamental Differences and encryption methods =====
	* block vs stream
	* block cipher:
		* fixed length group of bis (block)
		* each block of plaintext has an equiv size of block ciphertext
	* stream cipher:
		* encryption takes place bit by bit using a pseudorandom cipher digit stream or keystream
		* in a stream cipher each plaitext digit is encrypted one at a time

===== transport encryption =====
	* SSL/TLS security considerations
		* only as strong as the ciphers and hashing agreed ipon by both parties
		* MiTM attacks exist that force oth parties to agree to use unsecure protocols
	* SSH (secure shell)
		* secure remote sessions, file transfers, tunnelling, port forwarding etc
		* same security considerations as SSL/TLS
	* IPsec (Internet Security Protocol)
		* Authentication Header (AH)
			* Provides authentication and integrity
		* IPsec
			* Encapsulating Secure Payload (ESP)
				* provides confidentiality along with option integrity checking
				* adds a header, trailer and integrity check value or ICV

===== Repudiation =====
* Assurance that the author of a message cannot later refute ownership
	* asymmetric encryption functions on the premise of a secrete key only the sender know

===== Hashing =====
* mathematical algo applied to a file before and after transmission
	* if anyting within the file changes the hash will be completely different
* MD5, SHA1 and SHA2
* Hashing only works one way, cannot reverse engineer it to get the original text
* Hash has a fixed size regardless of the message

===== Key Escrow =====
* Keys needed to decrypt encrypted data are held in escrow to enable an authoried third party to access those keys
	* referred to as a "fair" cryptosystem
* Recovery Agents can be used to allow access to older keys

===== Steganography =====

===== Digital Signatures =====
* asymmetric encryption using pyblic key / private key (PKI)
