====== Use of Proven Technology ======
Created Monday 28 March 2016

===== Kerckhoffs' principle =====
* States that the security of an algo should dpend only on the secrecy of the key and not on the secrecy of the algorithm itself
* all of the generally used encryption algo are publicly accessible
	* they have been vetted by the security communicty for flaws, etc

===== Elliptic Curve Cryptography =====
* ECC
	* Asymmetric ecnr that uses algebraic structure of elliptic curves
		* strong encryption using smaller key size
* Asymmetric ecnry normally requires a large amount of resources
	* ECC can achieve same level of security with less resources

===== Quantum Cryptography =====
* The use of quantum mechanical properties to pefrom cryptographic tasks
	* the very act of eavesdropping disturbs the properties 
* Quantum Key Distribution
	* using quantum comm to esablish a shared ke betw two parties
	* Third party can't access or disturb the data without it being noticed by sendier/recepient

===== Ephemerial key =====
* temprary key that is used once
	* can be reused during single comm session

===== Perfect forward secrecy =====
* Session keys that are derrived froma  set of long term keys, yet discreet in nature
	* if one of th elong term keys is compromised, it doesn't compromise the session key or the data it protects
		* keys used to protect data arn't used to derive any additional keys
