====== SSM ======
Created Tuesday 26 April 2016

* In Observer design pattern, SSM is a data structure which plays a role as an **observable object**
* The **observer** object is that of type/sub-type of **ValueSlot**
	* â€¢ ValueSlot extends from SignalSlot
	* SignalSlot add/remove 'signal source' or (presumably) observable objects
* SSM typically wrap a list of values to be observed (ValueScope)
	* ValueScope is non-copyable
	* ValueScope wraps one or more ValueStore objects
		* ValueStore extends from AppSingleton
		* It adds/remove Value to/from its Store ie. set of ValueStoreEntry
			* ValueStoreEntry is a wrapper for Value
		* Each Value is added to each of the Observers
			* Observer is privately inherited from SignalSlot
