====== MoCA Eth priority over MoCA ======
Created Tuesday 29 March 2016

Enhancing Kokkee's patch in: https://gitgerrit-01.greenwavereality.eu/#/c/25061

===== 30/03/2016 =====
* Requirements conflicted:
	* "last interface to be retried after bootup" vs "Eth will be attempted/switched-to when both Eth and Moca are connected"
	* so stick with original patch from Kokkee
* Testing to see how long does it take to finally connected to Moca when both interface are connected but no DHCP from Eth. Breakdown:
	* Time for trying to connect to DHCP via Eth: 90 secs
	* Time to switch to Moca: 10-12 secs
	* Time to connect to DHCP and get IP (able to ping www.google.com successfully): 1-2 secs
	* **Total: 101~104 secs**
	* Logs captured [[./messages]] 

===== 29/03/2016 =====
Missing:
	* storing the last connected interface and
	* retry that interface first upon reboot
