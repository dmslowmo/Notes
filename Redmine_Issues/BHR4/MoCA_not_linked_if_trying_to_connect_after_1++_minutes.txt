====== MoCA not linked if trying to connect after 1++ minutes ======
Created Tuesday 22 March 2016

Redmine: https://support.greenwavereality.com/issues/26589
* Description:
	* build .48
	* Connect BHR4 to WAN with DHCP enabled
	* wait until it gets an IP
	* wait another 10 minutes
	* try to connect to MoCA
	* EXPECTED: MoCA gets IP from DHCP
	* ACTUAL: MoCA not linked
		* According to Gavin MoCA process got killed
			* But I could not reproduce it on .55
			* The log does not show enough information (got cut off on 9 March, suddenly resumed on 22 March and only showing very short time period)

* Findings:
	* BHR4 gets its internet connection from Eth WAN or MoCA WAN
	* It seems in this case, MoCA WAN is **expected** to be prioritized over Eth WAN
		* so, if Eth is already connected, then MoCA is connected, the internet connection source should switch to MoCA
	* **[recovery steps]** When we bumped into this bug, the way to recover is to:
		* keep MoCA connection
		* disconnect Eth WAN and wait
		* after about 2-3 minutes, the MoCA link is up again and BHR4 gets internet connection again
	* I suspect the **ETH** actually is prioritized over MoCA:
		* after bumping into this bug, perform the [recovery steps]
		* then reproduce this bug again:
			* reconnect Eth WAN
			* disconnect MoCA, and wait until //mocap 0 get --interface_status// keeps showing "Error -8". Usually takes around 3 minutes
			* reconnect MoCA. MoCA will not recover. Internet connection is still up (because of Eth WAN).
		* then perform the [recovery steps] again
