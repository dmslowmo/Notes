====== TestBytes greater than TotalBytes in Client FTP BW Test ======
Created Wednesday 16 March 2016

**16/03/2016**
Findings:
* Observed in Client
* Sometimes OK, not always bad
* Happens when the filesize is approx 10KB and below (needs more test, but at 500KB, didn't happen)
* Using Curl as Client: looks fine, even with 6-byte file
* Next:
	* FTP Client: tr143 diag?
	* check how the TestBytes and TotalBytes are computed
	* Check how SSM does it, perhaps need to clear some counter before starting new tests

**Findings:**
* Able to reproduce
* generally happens more on small data size, the smaller, the more likely it happens
* not able to run 1r143_diag from host (need to check with Zhou Bin on his latest change)
* still can run the tr143_diag standalone from inside BHR4 '/bin[[']] dir
	* shows same behaviour as from the upnp bandwidth test
	* it means this behaviour is from tr143_diag itself
* How TestBytes and TotalBytes are computed:
	* stats of the traffic from "br-lan" interface is collected
	* Still not clear on how it is computed, but underneath it is **curl** that does the actual transfer
	* tr143_diag just parse the results
	* There are 2 parameters:
		* "fullLoadTotalBytes"
			* when TestBytes are low (below ~100K), this value is usually extremely low (in the hundreds)
			* when TestBytes are high (above ~100K), the value is closer to the TestBytes (still lower)
		* "TotalBytes"
			* not same as "fullLoadTotalBytes"
			* when TestBytes are low, this value usually lower than TestBytes
			* when TestBytes are high, thsi value usually higher than TestBytes
