====== TODO ======
Created Friday 26 February 2016

To check:
[*] Connect the router to GDT and see under **users** the informations that remained (the router has been factory-reset before)
	* admin password remains as 'roses64bad' (expected)
	* password_salt shows some value. If this is erased the it should be restored after setting 'reset_password' to 'true' (expected)
	* if we change the 'reset_password' flag to **true**, it will immediately change back to false (expected)
	* CONCLUSION: seems that the password reset works correctly, but somehow user's input may not get through to the password checker, or some other reason.
	* putting this aside for now...
[*] See the codes related to this, see if we can find something
	* see above
