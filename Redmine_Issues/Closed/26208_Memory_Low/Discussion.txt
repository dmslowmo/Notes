		Recover from Low Memory			Reboot
1.3.0  		n/a (reboot too fast)					yes
1.3.1		no									yes		recent test with attempting to upgrade firmware will not free-up memory and memory does not recover much
1.3.2		no									yes		

Questions:
* What changes in 1.3.1 did not get propagated to 1.3.2?
	* Ans: This is probably irrelevant, now that we also see the memory not recovering even in 1.3.1
* What are the last few changes in 1.3.2 up to 1.3.2.19 which may cause this?
	* Ans: There is a Broadcomm Wifi driver related changes in 1.3.2.15. We should test 1.3.2.13.
	* Test outcome: problem also happens with this version
