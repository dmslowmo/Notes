[ ] [[https://support.greenwavereality.com/issues/19863#note-25|19863]] revisited:
	* Veerendra reported: 
	  //I don't the specified Q-See Camera Server to test. I have tested using D-Link DCS 932L and found the port forwarding entries working. //
	  //DCS-932L opens port 80 and 443 on the BHR for the WAN side access. In one scenario the port forwarding entries are swapped.//
	* Need to borrow the camera with similar model to reproduce and see the issue. Check with Minhou next week.
