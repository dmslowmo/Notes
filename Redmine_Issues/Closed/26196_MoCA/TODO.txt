[*] [[https://support.greenwavereality.com/issues/26196|26196]]: BHR4 MoCA and UI: Coax channel didn't show on UI correctly as configured on MoCA SPF device @moca 
	[*] How to set up MoCA?
		* Moca is still down, shown in GDT
		* The instructions didn't work, or my setup is wrong?
		* Any documentation on Moca setup?
		* BRICKED THE MOCA DEVICE!!!! :D:D:D ----> Actually, need to use Moca-enabled BHR4 instead of the one you "bricked"
	[*] Replicate the setup used by Eric Thu
	[*] Reproduced the problem
 
[*] So it seems that the SSM did not take the actual value ('from') to set the 'to' value
	[*] What variable stores the actual value that is changeable from the mocap cli ?
	* Hypothesis:
		* So the MocaWan's coaxChannel variable is set and get ONLY from GUI
		* but, NOT from //mocap// cli
[*] How does GDT gets the latest update?
	* //MocaApplyThread// is a runnable object that helps to do the update
	* It is spawned and started whenever there are changes to be applied or when connecting for the first time
	* In GDT //operFreq// stores the Moca operating frequency, similar to //coaxChannel// in GUI
	* However, coaxChannel is not updated by the MocaApplyThread
		* Could this be the cause? ⇒ seems so, BUT
		* After changing the code to get it updated, the GUI and console did not see the update until 2 mins later, which is too long
			* it should be immediate
		* Other info:
			* This bug observed in 01.04.00.34/35
			* The last time it passes in 01.04.00.26/27
			* Hence, we need to see what changes may cause this between 29..35 ⇒ not easy to see

[*] Try to download the firmware from the tags between 27a..33 and check which version this bug is observed
	[*] First observe the correct behaviour in .27
		[*] Even in this version the desired behaviour is not observed
		[*] Updated Redmine ticket on the observation in this version
		[*] QA (Gavin) will help to setup a forum with Hoang to discuss on this behaviour
	[*] then try one-by-one the higher version builds ⇒ ** no need**
	[*] Once found, we can narrow down the list of commits ⇒ **no need**
