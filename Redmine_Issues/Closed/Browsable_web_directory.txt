Created Thursday 10 March 2016

[[Browsable web directory|Cherokee]] is a web server.
Normally, all the configuration is done throught Cherokee-Admin, however, in BHR4 there is no admin module.
Instead, it is configured and compiled into the BHR4 binary, and unmodifiable at runtime.

Configuration is stored in cherokee.template.conf under //lego/products/bhr4/root/etc/cherokee/// directory.
The syntax of the configuration file is explained in http://cherokee-project.com/doc/dev_cherokee.conf.htmlhttp://cherokee-project.com/doc/dev_cherokee.conf.html

The browsable directories that need to be fixed:
* css
* ~~api-doc~~
* img_wh
* ~~swagger-ui~~
