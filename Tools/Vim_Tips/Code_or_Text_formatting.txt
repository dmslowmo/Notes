* To adjust the indent on three lines:
	* Put the cursor anywhere in the first line.
	* Press V then jj to visually select the three lines.
	* Press > to indent (shift text one 'shiftwidth' to the right), or press < to shift left.
	* Press . to repeat the indent, or u to undo if you have shifted too far.
	* Type gv if you want to reselect the lines (not needed).
* Alternatively, if you know that you want to adjust three lines, you can simply:
	* Type 3>> to shift right or 3<< to shift left. Or:
	* Type >2j to shift right or <2j to shift left.
As mentioned above, the > and < commands combine with arbitrary Vim movements and text objects.
For example, >} to indent from the cursor to the next blank line, or <aB to un-indent the current C-like {...} "block" structure.
