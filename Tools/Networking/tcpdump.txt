====== tcpdump ======
Created Monday 15 August 2016

* useful links:
	* https://danielmiessler.com/study/tcpdump/
	* http://www.rationallyparanoid.com/articles/tcpdump.html
* Quick tips:
	* to capture IPv6 packet, add //ip6// flag
	* unfortunately, we can only filter ICMP packets (IPv4), but not ICMPv6 packets, we may still get other packets other than ICMPv6
	* quick example: //tcpdump -ieth0 -n -v ip6//
