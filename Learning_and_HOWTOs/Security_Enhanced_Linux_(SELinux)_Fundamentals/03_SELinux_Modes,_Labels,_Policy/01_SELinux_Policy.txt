====== 01 SELinux Policy ======
Created Monday 04 April 2016

===== Decision-Making Process =====
* Default answer = NO
* All allowed access requires an **Allow Rule**
* policy look up results get stored to the Access Vector Cache or AVC
	* faster search

===== Targeted Policy =====
* Type Enforcement (TE)
	* using type label
* Targets (confines) specific daemons:
	* network facing
	* start at boot
* Everything else is UNCONFINED!
* User processes often not targeted
	* usually run in **unconfined_t**
* Target processes run in **confined** domains
	* or sandboxing
* Everything NOT targetred runs in an unconfined domain:
	* only subjected to DAC
	* no MAC policy control
* sesearch -l (search for domain)
* semodule -l (search for modules)
