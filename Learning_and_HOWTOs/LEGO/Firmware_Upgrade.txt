====== Firmware Upgrade ======
Created Thursday 21 April 2016

===== Recover from Bad Firmware Update =====
* when new firmware turns out to be bad
* we can recover by booting from the last version before upgrade
	* the old firmware is still on the hardware (BHR4), but different partition
	* Steps:
		* go to u-boot environment
		* execute **printenv** command and check from the list of command for **mtd_boot**
			* assuming it exists, execute: **run mtd_boot**

===== Building a New Major Version =====
* Eg. upgrading from 1.x to 2.x
	* there is likely to be a huge/breaking changes
* It is best to do //make superclean// before building
* It is also good to watch out for new version in master (if we regularly rebase to master)
