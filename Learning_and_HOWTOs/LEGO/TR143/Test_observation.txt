====== Test observation ======
Created Tuesday 16 August 2016

1. C773282: UDP Throughput Download Packet loss
	* Cannot find in GDT InternetGatewayDevice.UDPThroughput.UdpPortDownload.Results.PacketsLost/.PacketsLostRatio
	* Scheduler failed because not enough UDP ports available (requested is 4, only 1 available), hence test was not run
		* in acs-db.conf: UDPThroughputPortsNumber is 4. This may have to be set to 1.
2. C775457: UDP Throughput Upload Packet loss
	* typo: InternetGatewayDevice.X_D4A928_PerformanceDiagnostics.PerformDownloadThroughputTest = true
		* should be 'upload'
3. C689471: NextRequestTime is within the 2*TestRequestInterval from current time -Â­ TBD
	* Fail: NRT bit not set
