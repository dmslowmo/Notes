===== Set Up =====
The router needs to be registered in HDM:
1. In GDT, change:
	a. net.tr69_client.management_server.url to https://greenwave-bhr4test.verizon.com/cwmpWeb/CPEMgt (same URL can be used for BHR5)
	b. username is the //serial number// of BHR4/BHR5
	c. password is //verizon (for bhr4); for bhr5, don't change the value, should be automatically changed//
2. Make sure tr69_client is running (should run upon changing the parameters)
3. In HDM, try to find our router by searching the serial ID

===== Controlling the BHR4 parameters =====
1. perform GPV to get the latest parameter values from GDT (connected to BHR4)
2. perform SPV to make any changes

GPV/SPV are just some of the operations that can be done via HDM's **Queue Function** tab (on bottom right panel)
So we have to select the operation, queue it, and send it to BHR (there should be a button appearing on bottom left to Send/Queue/Add).
