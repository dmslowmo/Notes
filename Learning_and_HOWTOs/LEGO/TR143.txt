===== Overview =====
TR143 is for throughput test.
Important keywords/concepts to remember:
1. GDT: net/tr69/diagnostic
2. libpcap ---- packet capture, used to get information about a packet
	a. typically used to capture first and last packets
	b. in order to see the timestamp
	c. or may be other info
3. tcpdump --- linux utility, but executed from within tr143_diag
	a. the results are dumped to stdout
	b. and in tr143_diag, there is a filter to extract selective information
4. iPerf --- to perform througput test on the kernel
	a. used as benchmark for tr143_diag
5. HDM:
	a. on-demand in nature
	b. used to trigger changes in bhr4/5
	c. useful when trigger needs to change multiple parameters at once
	d. Website URL: 10.0.7.35:7003/hdm
	e. username: netopmgr
	f. password: gws241115 (NOTE: QA changes the username and password from time to time, so need to check with them, or their Wiki)
	g. To set in GDT: tr69 client managerment server's
		1. url: https://greenwave-bhr4test.verizon.com/cwmpWeb/CPEMgt
		2. username: serial id
		3. passw: verizon (for bhr4); for bhr5, don't change the value, should be automatically changed
	h. So, by right when tr69 client starts, it connects to the HDM server and register the router, and after that it should appear in HDM website
	i. At first the "Activated" column may show "X". It may take a while before it is changed to 'v' (OK) sign.
6. Test Controller
	a. Verizon's propietary
	b. can set scheduled test
	c. there are value mirrors between HDM, bhr, and TestController
	d. Test server URL: 10.0.10.241
		* user: gws
		* paswd: thinkgreen
	e. The test server application and configuration are in [[/opt/vmi]]
		* [[/opt/vmi/bin:]] where the .jar of the test tester and scheduler are
		* [[/opt/vmi/etc:]] configurations
		* restarting the server/scheduler can be done via [[/etc/init.d/vmi-<tester]] or scheduler>
		* Check the results via brower at 10.0.10.241:9090/results
	f. GDT settings in net.tr69.diagnostics.:
		* cfg_test_control: **This is the setting for working with Test Controller**
		* (the settings that worked for me, or default)
			* **client_version_number**: 1
			* debug_cmd: 0
			* debug_cmd_ext: 0
			* debug_dl_url:
			* debug_ul_url:
			* device_serial_number:
			* **download_transports**: HTTP, FTP, UDPThroughput, DNS, WebPage (but when specifying in **'url'** field, use **"http", "ftp", "UdpThroughput"**, etc (not sure about DNS and WebPage))
			* downstream_speed_tier:
			* GWR_ID:
			* LATA_ID:
			* low_activity_resolution: 50
			* low_activity_threshold: 0
			* low_activity_wait_expiration_count: 0
			* low_activity_wait_expiration_time: 30
			* low_activity_wait_time: 0
			* OLT_ID: 0
			* ONT_ID: 0
			* **perform_download_throughput_test**: set to 'true' to run
			* **perform_upload_throughput_test:** set to 'true' to run
			* **requested_test_protocol**: (select from the list according the test you want to run)
			* **test_request_interval**: test will be run each time this interval elapsed (in Seconds)
			* **test_request_limit**: how many times the test should be requested and run
			* **test_request_timeout:** duration in ms before timeout
			* **test_request_UDP_port**: 9000 — the port at tester which BHR sends UDP requests to (see tester.conf in [[/opt/vmi/etc/]])
			* **test_results_TCP_port**: 8000 — the port at BHR which tester sends results to
			* **test_server_IP_address**: test controller host IP address
			* **throughput_testing_enabled**: to enable/disable the throughput test
			* upload_transports: HTTP, FTP, UDPThroughput
			* upstream_speed_tier:
		* udp_throughput:
			* cmd_path: /bin/tr143_diag
			* ctrl_tcp_port: 6020
				* this is the default port that BHR listen to for the commands from the tester in 10.0.10.241
				* commands such as: init/config, start, end, close (see ECR)
				* the init/config command will auto-populate all internal parameters required on the GDT
			* udp_port:
				* Download
					* results: should show some numbers if test has run correctly (for download test)
				* Upload:
					* results: should show some numbers if test has run correctly (for upload test)
			* udp_port_list: 6030
		* download:
			* concurrent_sessions: number of download sessions created. If you set upload for x MB, then since there are 4 sessions, the actual download will be 4*x MB.
			* url: eg. http://10.0.10.87:9999/test.zip
				* use the protocol appropriate for the test
				* for http/ftp, must have file name to be downloaded (dummy one)
				* This url is used if the test does not involve Test Controller, and consequently, you need to have an actual file server at that url
				* use //tr143_fileserver <httpport> <ftpport> <file size in MB> //running in that url
		* upload:
			* concurrent_sessions: number of upload sessions created. If you set upload for x MB, then since there are 4 sessions, the actual upload will be 4*x MB.
			* url: UdpThroughput://localhost:10:0:6030:6031:6032:6033 (for UDP)
				* set it according to the protocol tested (http, ftp, etc)
