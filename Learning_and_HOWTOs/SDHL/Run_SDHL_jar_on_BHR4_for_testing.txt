====== Run SDHL jar on BHR4 for testing ======
Created Friday 22 July 2016

===== View logs =====
To view the log messages of SDHL, you need to change the logging properties of SDHL.
Currently, on BHR4 1.4, this is configured in /usr/local/apps/dasmo/logging.properties and SDHL is default to SEVERE at the moment.
This directory is readonly so you need to copy this file to /mnt/config/dasmo/logging.properties.
After that, edit the file and change the SDHL Log file level to a lower level, FINEST will display everything.

	com.gwr.dasmo.vz.launcher.logger.SDHLLogFileHandler.level=FINEST.

Once you save the file, use ps to find the process ID of the siege JVM, then kill it to trigger SDHL to be restarted with the new log level.
You can also change the other settings to get a larger log file and location of the log (i.e. /mnt/usbstick/sdhl%u.log )

===== Run SDHL jar =====
SDHL jar can be put in [[/mnt/config]] or [[/mnt/usbstick.]]
Restart BHR4.

===== Create rule for testing =====
How to create a rule which will trigger periodically, regardless?
