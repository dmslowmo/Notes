====== 6. IPv6 and DNS ======
Created Wednesday 16 March 2016

===== New in DNS for IPv6 =====
	* new recored type: **AAAA (128 bits)**
	* new reverse record domain
	* RFC3363

===== DNS Design configuration: =====
	* multiple records for the same host
	* you can query DNS via IPV4 or 6

===== IPv6 DNS resolution over IPv4 is possible =====
* can be confusing to know which protocol is used
* can be difficult to troubleshoot problem
* apps can get confused
* use tools to tst and confirm
* Eg of failed resolution. Flow:
	* the host address is eg 192.168.10.230
	* host DNS server is 192.168.200.2 whchi got it via DHCPv4
	* DNS query for www.example.com
	* DNS server replies back with an AAAA IPv6 address
	* the query and reply happen over IPv4
* So we need to do everything in IPv4 or everything IPv6, not mixed!
* IPv6 DNS query resolution eg:
	* host addr is 2001:db8:cafe:1234::230
	* hosts DNS server is 2001:db8::1 which it got via DHCPv6 or RDNSS
	* DNS query for www.example.com
	* DNS server replies back with an AAAA IPv6 addr
	* both the query and reply happen over IPv6 â†’ success
* More likely? Do both:
	* Most common in dual-stack hosts is to have both IPv4 and v6 records
* IPv6 DNS query blacklist:
	* host addr is .... (IPv4 addr)
	* host DNS server is ... which it got via DHCPv4
	* query for www.example.com
	* DNS server replies back with an A record IPv4 only
	* because the query happens over IPv4
	* and the IPv6 is blacklisted
* Recommendation: don't use IPv6 DNS query blacklist

===== IPv6 DNS in LInux =====
	* via DHCPv6

===== IPv6 DNS Server in Linux =====
	* install bind9

===== Tools (Linux): =====
	* dig
	* nslookup
