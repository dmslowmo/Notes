====== 0. Introduction ======
Created Tuesday 15 March 2016

* 128-bit addressing (vs ipv4's 32-bit)
* uses Hex address format (vs ipv4's dotted eg 192.168.1.1)
* header structure is different vs ipv4
	* certain fields not supported by ipv6 (eg header checksum, options, padding)
		* fragmentation fields
		* options
		* header checksum
		* header length (fixed to 40B in ipv6)
		* length fields
	* new fields originally not in ipv4 (eg flow label)
	* Equivalent fields:
		* ipv4:
			* Total length
			* time to live
			* type of service
			* protocol
			* source addr
			* destination addr
		* ipv6:
			* payload length
			* hop limit
			* service class
			* next header
			* source addr (4x longer)
			* destination addr (4x longer)
* Anycast (vs Broadcast in ipv4)
	* Multicast can be used as Multicast and Broadcast in ipv6
	* Stateless auto config
		* new host can assign itwown host addr
		* no need for DHCP
	* supports new IP secirit protocols
		* authentication of source
		* encryption of payload
	* both v4 and v6 limit payload size to 64KB, BUT,
		* ipv6 has Jumbo Payload feature that allow up to 4GB payload
	* **ipv6 i snot backward compatible with ipv4 !!!**
		* it is a parallel, independent network
