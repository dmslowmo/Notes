====== 7. Router advertisement ======
Created Wednesday 16 March 2016

* Fundamentally different from IPv4

===== What is RAs? =====
* RAs are how hosts
	* obtain the default gateway
	* in some cases, learn DNS server info
	* determine if they should do SLAAC or DHCPv6 or both
	* learn what Global Unicast or ULA prefix to use for that interface

===== Flow =====
	* host addr (fe80::eca1:345c:fa5b:c5ac)
	* router addr 2001:db8:cafe:1234::1/64, RA prefix is therefore 2001:db8:cafe:1234::/64
	* the router on a regular interval will do a router adevertisement on the local link segment
	* the host will get the RA and know what prefix and default gateway to use based on the RA message
	* the host builds: **2001:db8:cafe:eca1:345c:fa5b:c5ac**
	* when a host comes up it will do a Route Solicitation (RS)


===== RAs Role in IPv6 =====
	* think IPv4 'Default Gateway'
	* an RA is an automatic way to get the Default Gatway (Router) information

===== Why are RAs Part of Neigbor Discovery? =====
* the neigbor discovery protocol handles:
	* host addr auto configration
	* discovery of neigbor hosts
	* determining lik layer addr of other hosts
	* finding routers
	* prefix discovery
	* reachability of other hosts
	* REMEMBER: all of this works on the Link Layer or "On Link"

===== Difference vs IPv4 =====
* no need to manually setup default gateway
* DHCPv6 does not provide the default gatewa info
* can have several router performing RAs
* IPv4 has nothing like RAs: it's a replacement of Default Gateway mechanism
* with multiple Router: how it works:
	* on router should be given a higher preference so the host will use that router as its default gateway
	* the routers on a regular intervall will do a router advertisement on the local link segment
	* the host will get the RA and know what prefix and defalt gateway to use based on the RA message
	* this works if the RAs are for the **same** prefix
	* bt the failover from one router to the other can take a while

===== Recommendation =====
* RAs are critical: understand it!
* use High Vailability or HA methods like VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol)
* RAs are not optional
* RAs should be controlled to avoid exploit or problems

===== How is RAs used? =====
* obtain the default gateway
* in some cases, learn DNS server info
* determine if the should do SLAAC or DHCPv6 or both
* learn what global unicast or ULA prefix for that particular interface

===== on Windows =====
* only obtains an IPv6 DNS resolver addr via DHCPv6, but no RDNSS (recursive DNS server)
* if you set up windows server as a router it will always have the A bit set

===== On Linux =====
* linux can obtain an IPv6 DNS resolver addr via DHCPv6 or SLAAC (RDNSS)
* Android does not have DHCPv6 client, so SLAAC with RDNSS is required

===== On OSX =====
* OSX can obtain an IPv6 DNS resolver addr via DHCPv6 or SLAAC (RDNSS)
* iOS has a DHCPv6 client and can also learn DNS info from RDNSS
