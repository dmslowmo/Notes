===== Neighbor Discovery Protocol =====
* replaces ARP in IPv4
* leverages multicast to allow host to discover neighbor in layer 2

===== Anycast Addresses =====
* Global Anycast DNS allows for faster reachability and high availability to name servers on the Internet
* Local Anycast DNS allows for high availabilit for name servers
* helps to mitigate DDOS due to how it functions
* provides a stable IPv4 or IPv5 addr for services (NTP, DHCPv6 or DNS)
* typically requires the use of a routing protocol such as OSPFv3 to route inject
* not possible to tell the diff betw an Anycast addr and a Global Unicast Addr
	* it is just a **functional behavior of** Unicast addr
	* Use cases:
		* Global DNS
		* Local DNS
		* caching services
