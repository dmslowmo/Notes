====== 5. Representing IPv6 Network ======
Created Wednesday 16 March 2016

===== Prefix =====

	* indicates significant network bits
	* "/" between the network and the address prefix value
	* range from 0-128
	* RFC4291 sect 2.3

===== A nibble is 4 bits =====

	* //2001:aaaa:bbbb:cccc::/64// means network address utilizes the 1st 64 bits (provider assigned)
	* the rest of the the 64 bits used by the Host portion (locally assigned)
	* notice the "::" ie zero compression. it's normal
	* eg //2001:aaa:bbbb::/48. //In this case the remaining 16 bit is used as subnet
	* a full specific host route will have "/128[["]] after it

===== Ipv6 network prefix and subnetting =====

	* 2001:aaaa:bbbb:/48
	* **2001:aaaa:bbbb**:__cccc__:dddd:eeee:ffff:1111
		* bold: 48 bits address
		* highlighted: 16 bits to subnet
	* **FE**80::/10 (Link Local — RFC4291)
		* in reality this is "/64"
		* cannot subnet it
	* **2000**::/3 ⇒ Global Unicast
	* **FC**00::/7 ⇒ Unique local
	* **FF**00::/8 ⇒ Multicast

===== Prefix policy table =====

	* Host routing policy table defaults
	* RFC 6724
	* NOT the routing table
	* Thik of it as a decision tree for hosts OS
	* In Microsoft Windows:
		* OS version dependent (RFC 3484 vs RFC 6724)
		* Limited Powershell cmdlets
		* netsh is available
	* In Linux:
		* "/etc/gai.conf" file in Ubuntu
		* distribution dependent (file is blank in CentOS/RedHat)
		* Older linux may still be on 3484
	* Prefix policy table impacts
		* defines the source addr selection
		* longest profix match is the normal win
		* multiple golbal unicast addresses makes the deicision process more difficult
