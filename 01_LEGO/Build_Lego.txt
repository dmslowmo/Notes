====== Build Lego ======
Created Wednesday 06 December 2017

Follow the instruction in https://support.greenwavereality.com/projects/gwr-embedded/wiki/Build_BHR4, and then fix as necessary (errors may be system dependent).

See the error and Google it, perhaps there are missing dependencies. Else, ask colleagues :)

For my environment (Linux Mint 18.x), some additional steps:
* install help2man
* install libltdl-dev
* install autopoint
