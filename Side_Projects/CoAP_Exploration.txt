1. Updated Coap wiki
2. Asked permission to do knowledge sharing after the weekly team meeting

23 Feb 2016
1. Managed to run simple test with libcoap client and microcoap server, as well as Web Client via Firefox+Copper
2. Updated the wiki page. With this, I think it's enough for now
3. Next is to plan for porting to GreenWave's hardware:
	a. port the server to a device eg BHR4 or Onegateway
	b. Execute commands via REST from Web client (Firefox + Copper)
	c. enhance the server to do meaningful things eg. return real info or reading etc
