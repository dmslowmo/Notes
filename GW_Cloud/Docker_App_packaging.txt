====== Docker App packaging ======
Created Monday 31 October 2016

* Dockerfile
	* a file that contains specific steps/configuration needed to build and run the docker app

* Essential docker commands
	* build
	* exec
	* kill
	* inspect
	* login
	* logout
	* images
	* port
	* ps
	* pull
	* push
	* rm — remove container
	* rmi — remove images
	* run
	* tag

* Docker ports
	* [[Host_port:container_port]]
		* eg 12002:8080
		* that means, we can have multiple application, which assume, they are working on port 8080

* Docker volumes
	* when docker container run with db and restarted, all data will be lost
	* solution: volume
		* mapping host volume to container volume

* Essential Dockerfile commands
	* FROM - declare a bse img to use
	* ENV - setup env var
	* ADD — add file to docker container. Remove urls are supported
	* COPY
	* RUN - run any script to modify container
	* CMD and ENTRYPOINT — exec this commnad when container iss started. Only one CMD is allowed
	* VOLUME - define durable storage. Simply saying this is a dir mapped to external dir. All changes inside the docker container will be gone, except volumes

* Make (makefile)
	* for building, tagging, release jobs

* How does Docker get all the dependencies required?
	* no Maven in release Docker img. It's too large
	* we need to have all jar files in container folder before we start docker build command
	* to do that, we need a separate Docker container with Maven installed
		* dedicated to download all deps
		* into build/lib dir

* Docker Compose
	* for dealing with multiple docker images
	* docker-compose.yml
	* docker-compose can do build, but it is recommended to use make for build
