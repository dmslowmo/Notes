====== 04 Switch between remote Cassandra on the fly ======
Created Wednesday 07 June 2017

===== Current state =====
* Cassandra Cluster and Session beans are //eagerly instantiated// by Spring
	* Such that, if connection is unavailable, the app will not even start
* Hostname is stored in the Run table of simulator keyspace
* Target cloud's URL is hardcoded in the app.conf and cannot be changed on the fly ie needs to recompile the JAR
* Simulation data is written directly into monitor keyspace

===== What we want =====
* Load Simulator is able to run without Cassandra Cluster and Session beans until it is required
* OR, have local cassandra with simulator keyspace, and only create Cluster and Session for axon keyspace when needed
	* the URL will have to be supplied by the caller
* API needs to change to include target server's URL
* Load Simulator does not depend on the target cloud's URL, or just default it to 'localhost' until a request is made
* Simulation data should not be written by Load Simulator directly, but rather it's done via Fronttier -> Backtier -> Firehose -> Cassandra

==== How the message flow works ====
* messages sent to the Fronttier is sent to Kafka
* the messages are consumed by **backtier and firehose**
	* Not sure what backtier does with the messages
	* Firehose then writes data to cf_monitor_* tables
* For Load Simulation, the simulated-device's threads will write the data to cf_simulator_monitor_* tables
* see https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xfzMynMGRPoo611C6qNzAZVXGTL0-cSyPTUldHNzqyI/edit#slide=id.g1388edfbd5_0_63

==== Possible solution: ====
* removing dependency to //monitor// keyspace:
	* migrate the cf_simulator_monitor-* tables to separate keyspace, say, **simulator_monitor**
	* simulator keyspace can run in the local Cassandra just as simulator keyspace
	* while axon and monitor keyspace is from the remote Cassandra
	* Hence, need to configure in app.conf the Fronttier to be in remote Cloud eg. axon-dev, and Cassandra in localhost
