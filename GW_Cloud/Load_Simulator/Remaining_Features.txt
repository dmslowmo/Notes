====== Remaining Features ======
Created Monday 05 December 2016

**Backend proxy**
required because frontend REST calls over HTTP is not allowed as Epoxy runs in HTTPS mode
[*] Api classes (split per page). This is the REST end point
	[*] LoadSimulatorSimulationsApi
	[*] LoadSimulatorProfilesApi
	[*] LoadSimulatorSimulationRunsApi
[*] Service classes
	[*] LoadSimulatorSimulationsService
	[*] LoadSimulatorProfilesService
	[*] LoadSimulatorSimulationRunsService
[*] Model classes. This is for REST calls to the LoadSimWeb
	[*] LoadSimulatorSimulationsModel
	[*] LoadSimulatorProfilesModel
	[*] LoadSimulatorSimulationRunsModel
[*] Update EpoxyApiServiceFactory

**Simulations**
[*] Simulation's Profile Detail list on clicking the 'down-arrow' icon (read only)
[*] Simulation's Detail on clicking the Simulation Name (can edit)
[*] Edit Simulation (same as above)

**Profiles**
[*] NEW Profile page with Device attachment
[*] Profile's detail on clicking the Profile name (can edit)
[*] Edit Profile (same as above)

**Simulation Runs**
[*] Simulation's Profile Detail list on clicking the 'down-arrow' icon (read only, same as in Simulation)
[*] Simulation Run detail on clicking the Simulation ID or Name
	[*] accounts, gateways, devices
	[*] charts
		[*] using Highcharts, tooltip and crosshair included

[*] Page navigation (1,2,3...)
	[*] Might have been done for Simulations and Profiles, but have to check (database has been reset recently)
	[*] Not yet implemented in SimulationRuns
[*] Show 'Stop' icon when simulation is still running
[*] Log Message field when expanding the chevron icon
	[*] Wait for Ruth to change the UI
[*] BUG: chevron profile list expansion doesn't appear
[*] BUG: charts not showing
[*] Charts data should change when query is more specific ie with account, gateway, devices specified

**Others**
[*] Error handling (nice error messages)
[*] Enable deleting a Simulation or Profile from within detail page
[x] Check whether the Simulation/Profile is used by a running simulation
	[x] Problem: need to download all SimulationRun data and then search for the simulation whether it is running, and what profiles it uses
	[x] Since we don't want to modify Mintdata source for now, workaround is to use MemCache
