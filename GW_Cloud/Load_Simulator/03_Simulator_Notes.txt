====== 03 Simulator Notes ======
Created Thursday 19 January 2017

* When a **Simulation** starts:
	* process monitor is created (HeartBeater?)
	* each profile in the simulation is provisioned:
		* gateway, XMPP gateway account are created and stored in **Cassandra**
	* task (per device) are executed in round-robin fashion
	* events are recorded in Cassandra (if the option is selected)
* Each Simulation run is a process
	* ie, if you have 5 simulation running, there are 5 processes running inside the Docker container
	* they consume quite a bit of resources (24% memory)
