====== 03 Major Refactoring ======
Created Thursday 09 March 2017

[ ] Revamp (2nd time) of load simulator:
	[ ] Use new DB schema from DB team
	[ ] Applications need major overhaul including Frontend:
		[ ] Frontend and HTML of Load Simulator app in Epoxy
			* change all "by id" operations to "by name"
	[ ] REST Proxy in Epoxy
		* all URL that accepts [[/{id}]] needs to change to [[/{name}]]
		* Services need to change
	[ ] REST endpoint in Axon-cloud's load-simulator-web
		* all URL that accepts [[/{id}]] needs to change to [[/{name}]]
		* implementations change as Service layer also change
	[ ] Services and DAO in cassandra-db
	[ ] Boostrap
	[ ] simulator-launcher
	[ ] scheduler
[x] Can we totally build everything from scratch?
	[*] Not part of axon-cloud project
	[*] Use any technology we choose
	[*] Use different language?
	[*] Consideration:
		[*] cassandra-db already independent of other module
		[*] We can re-implement the logic of bootstrap, launcher, and scheduler once we understand the logic
		[*] It's totally different application from existing load simulator
		[*] but more testing needed, logic totally changed
		[*] **Still need to depend on Cassandra-tier!!** â‡’ this is a deal breaker. This module can be changed anytime without notice and we have to track its changes anyway even when we build our own.
	[*] CONCLUSION: **CANNOT!!**

[*] __Major refactoring of the "Simulation Runner" modules__:
	[*] load-simulator-launcher
	[*] schedule-service
	[*] bootstrap
	[*] load-db may need to be refactored, but try not to

===== 09/03/2017 =====
[*] List of Types from load-db needed by the Simulation Runner modules:
	[*] scheduler-service
		[*] Device
		[*] DeviceType
		[*] DeviceReportType
		[*] DeviceReportUnit
		[*] ScheduleItem
	[*] bootstrap
		[*] Device
		[*] DeviceType
		[*] Profile
		[*] Run
		[*] ScheduleItem
		[*] Simulation
		[*] SimulationProfile
		[*] deviceService
		[*] DeviceTypeService
		[*] ProfileService
		[*] RunService
		[*] ScheduleItemService
		[*] SimulationProfileService
		[*] SimulationService
	[*] simulation-launcher
		[*] SimulationService
		[*] ProfileService
		[*] Simulation
[x] If dbmanager were to support load-db and cassandra-db, it needs to replace the dependencies above with its own versions of those types
[x] Replace those types from load-db using the dbmanager's version
[*] ALTERNATIVELY,
	[*] have Cassandra's version of bootstrap, schedule-service, load-simulator-launcher
	[*] load-simulator-web has to choose at runtime based on configuration which implementation to use
