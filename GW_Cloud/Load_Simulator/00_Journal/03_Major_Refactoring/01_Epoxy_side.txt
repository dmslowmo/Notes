====== 01 Epoxy side ======
Created Tuesday 04 April 2017

===== Development Checklist =====

=== Sprint 2 (2nd half) ===
[ ] API
[ ] Service
[ ] Test API and Service with Postman
[ ] Frontend
	[ ] new set of Javascript and HTML
	[ ] ~~but no change in UI look and feel~~
	[ ] minor change: make Simulation and Profile name read-only because it is used as PRIMARY KEY now
		[ ] Simulation name in Simulation page
		[ ] Profile name in Profile page and Simulation detail page
		[ ] When creating a new Simulation, need to pass the **profile names**
		[ ] If possible, also add **created** timestamp
[ ] Test Simulator with Epoxy Frontend (simple test, SimulationRun may not work)

==== Sprint 3 (Integration Testing) ====
[ ] Testing and bugfixing
	[ ] Create Profile
	[ ] Edit Profile
	[ ] Delete Profile
	[ ] Create Simulation
	[ ] Show Simulation details (expand details)
	[ ] Edit Simulation
	[ ] Delete Simulation
	[ ] Run Simulation
	[ ] Stop Simulation
	[ ] Show SimulationRun details (expand details)
		[ ] both stopped and running
		[ ] even when simulation is deleted
	[ ] Search Running Simulation only
[ ] Switching over to the new Frontend and API in Epoxy

===== General Requirements =====
* Implementing new database in Cassandra, with optimized schema from DB Team requires Frontend and API to change.
* Service layer probably needs to change as well.
* The old Load Simulator add-on in Epoxy is to remain intact.

===== General Plan =====

==== Frontend ====
* Copy from current frontend, but do not switch to this frontend yet until the backend is ready
* backend (axon-cloud) should be done first

==== API ====
* Also copy from current one and modify but keep the current one

==== Service ====
* Whole new implementation, but mostly can be copy-pasted, just change "by id" to "by name"
