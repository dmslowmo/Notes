[ ] On the Run page, the Stop icon doesn't turn into stop timestamp upon stopping the simulation run. It could be that it's not refreshing or the refresh is too early
[ ] On the Simulation/Profile page, the refreshed page do not show the correct list of Simulation/Profile upon editing the list via delete button

[*] DELETE does not pass the query parameter
[*] Broken feature: COPY/CLONE
	* When a profile/simulation is copied, the string '(Copy)' is appended to the original name
	* However, if even the new name already exists, save will fail
	* Fixes:
		[*] Error message pop up when save fails
		[*] Need to open the Profile edit page and allow the user to edit the name (only for create new)
		[*] Edit profile affected:
			[*] Should we allow editing of names? It's complex because:
				[*] It will insert instead of update as name is PRIMARY KEY
				[*] Delete the old one and insert new one in one update operation, make frontend complex:
					[*] insert new one
					[*] fetch existing one
					[*] delete existing one
			[x] OR, create something like 'Copy-2, Copy-3, ...'
				[x] Simpler, but potentially slows down the app when there are already so many copies
