[*] Profile page
	[*] list
	[*] create
	[*] view profile
	[*] edit profile
		[*] have not handled profile name (need to disable editing)
		[*] other fields edited and can be saved
		[*] But adding/removing Devices still does not work (not saved)
		[*] also, the disabled #name field returns name value of "0"
		[*] added underscore '_' before {profileName} ie [[/profiles/_{profileName}]] to handle corner cases ie the name starts with 'new' or 'clone'
	[*] clone
		[*] change: upon clicking 'clone' button, page goes to url: [[/profiles/clone/{profileName}?created={created}]]
		[*] user need to change the name before it is able to save
		[*] upon clicking save, it makes HTTP POST to create new profile
	[*] delete
