====== 01 Wire up DTO and Service layer ======
Created Friday 03 March 2017

===== 31/03/2017 =====
* Discovered design flaw in schedule item table
	* It's not really practical to add simulation_id column in there, because populating the column becomes really hard
	* Many other tables need to be queried, defeat the purpose of adding the column in the first place
* Going to try DB Team's schema
* Otherwise, removed simulation_id and profile_id from schedule_item table
	* Then to search schedule_item by simulation_id, we have to query multiple tables (inefficient, but if no other choice...)

===== 27-29/03/2017 =====
[ ] Fixing DI wiring for cassandra profile:
	[*] can start the Simulator
	[ ] Add device doesn't respond
	[ ] Save profile throw NullPointerException from CassandraResourceBl.checkProfileNameUsed()
	[ ] other errors expected, probably from Bean naming and lack of @Qualifier

===== 24/03/2017 =====
[ ] SimulationStateWatcher still depends on load-db, need to refactor
[*] imported cassandra axon keyspace data to my local cassandra, now no need to connect to remote cassandra
[ ] still a lot of DI problem, bean not found etc when running with cassandra profile

===== 23/03/2017 =====
[ ] Need to read environment's active profile instead of depending on application.conf
	[ ] fixed that in SimulationLaunchServiceImpl
	[ ] need to remove the usage of DatabaseCassandraChoice.java and DatabaseMysqlChoice.java

===== 21/03/2017 =====
[ ] Table review
	[ ] no need profile id, just use name
	[ ] use custom type to store multiple instance of an entity that are related to a row eg profile — devices, simulation — profiles
	[ ] for simulator.ids table, use counter instead of managing it in the application

===== 16/03/2017 =====
[*] Refactor Hearbeater and SimulationLauncherService
[*] Cassandra implementation of SimulationRunData
[x] Unable to test SimulatorApp

===== 15/03/2017 =====
[*] Able to run Simulation without XMPP error once we use Cassandra DB in Cloud instead
	[*] the axon keyspace has the data required for authentication to fronttier, most probably the reason
[*] Use @Profile and //'-Dspring.profile.active='// argument to select Bean implementation of SimulationLaunchService
[*] Refactor SimulationLaunchServiceConfig.java, separate config for mysql and cassandra launch service config:
	[*] MysqlSimulationLaunchServiceConfig.java
	[*] CassandraSimulationLaunchServiceConfig.java
[ ] Can we improve the current settings:
	[ ] need to set "mysql" or "cassandra" in multiple places:
		[ ] **configuration**: load-simulator-web's **application.conf**
		[ ] **run script**: load_web.sh
[*] Unit tests need to use @IfProfileValues to ignore/run them depending on active profile during build with build.sh
	[*] DRAWBACK: cannot run test on IDE. Need to force the required profile active using @ActiveProfiles
	[*] However, this annotation must be commented out before build.sh

===== 14/03/2017 =====
[*] Simulation Run problem:
	[*] was due to missing tables. After missing tables added manually, SimulationApp can be launched
	[*] Simulation running, data generated, graph showing
	[*] Connection to fronttier via xmpp establish
	[x] Still failed to send message to fronttier via xmpp
		[x] LOG: 8993     2017-03-14 16:02:46,760          [ERROR] [   device-executor-1]            c.g.l.s.s.i.StandaloneSimulatedDevice:127   - Failed to send xmpp message
		org.jivesoftware.smack.sasl.SASLErrorException: SASLError using PLAIN: not-authorized
		**The setup**: run LoadSimulator with Cassandra's axon keyspace and MySQL DB in localhost


===== 13/03/2017 =====
[*] Fixed build, able to start Load Simulator now, but...
[ ] Running Load Simulator locally still not 100% working
	[*] Startup OK
	[*] Create Profile OK
	[*] Create Simulation OK
	[x] Start Simulation NG
		[ ] Failed Bean injection related to Cassandra axon tables: Table metadata is null

===== 10/03/2017 =====
[ ] __LoadSimWeb build pass, but failed at runtime because "could not inject CassandraSimulationResourceBl". But why? I don't want this Bean because I configure for mysql!__

===== 08/03/2017 =====
[ ] Implementing CassandraResourceBl
	[*] CassandraDeviceResourceBl
	[*] CassandraProfileResourceBl
	[ ] CassandraSimulationRunResourceBl
		[*] Needs to add columns in Simulation:
			[*] cumulative_profiles
		[*] and Simulation_run tables
			[*] cumulative_profiles
			[*] original_simulation_id
		[*] Modify the Repository Pojos and Service classes
		[ ] Unit tests

===== 03/03/2017 =====
TODO:
[ ] Refactor LoadSimulatorWeb module:
	[*] move the existing Resource business logic to MySQLResourceBL
		[*] Create Configuration for "mysql" and "cassandra"
			[*] backend.database = "mysql" in application.conf
			[*] if something other than "mysql" is specified, the default is cassandra
		[*] Achieved using @Conditional
	[ ] ~~create ResourceBLFactory to instantiate MySQLResourceBL and CassandraResourceBL~~
	[*] Still need to resolve for MysqlSimulationResource and MysqlSimulationRunResource:
		[*] Dependency to AxonCassandraConfig.class !!!!
			[*] created a wrapper AxonCassandraWrapperConfig.class to import AxonCassandraConfig.class and do lazy loading on the beans from AxonCassandraConfig.
		[*] Dependency to MonitorCassandraConfig.class
			[*] Simply move the import to MysqlResourceConfig.class
	[*] Using @Profile and @Conditional
		[*] Needed to mark the LoadServiceConfig.class in db module to be loaded only when profile is not "ResourceTest", to avoid it being loaded in unit test in LoadSimWeb module
	[*] which one to create is based on ~~hard-coded constant or~~ config file
	[ ] consider using Spring dependency injection, something like https://spring.io/blog/2014/11/04/a-quality-qualifier
	[ ] Both implements ResourceBusinessLogic
	[ ] CassandraResourceBL
		[ ] uses Service from cassandra-db module
[ ] Fix remaining TODOs in cassandra-db module
	[*] get the keyspace name, port, and hostname from config file
	[*] remove dependence on com.grenwave.cassandra.common
	[ ] create merge request
