[ ] subscriptions mechanism
	* Prior work:
		* login to XMPP server endpoint with an account (JID)
		* upon establishing connection to XMPP server, (according to CS), the client (ifttt-broker) is already listening to pushed messages from server (need to verify)
	* (UIx) sends subscription request to Cloud (ie Fronttier's endpoint: fronttier:8080/http-bind for BOSH, or the normal XMPP ie fronttier:5222[[)]]
	* subscription created, now listening for notification
[ ] XMPP connection mechanism
	* BOSH (fronttier port 8080/http-bind)
	* XMPP (fronttier port 5222)
[ ] XMPP library to use
	* Smack (recommended, because the mobile and UI team uses it)
	* Babbler (new, still not 1.0 yet, but looks interesting)
[ ] in ifttt project, the subscription for notification flow is roughly:
	* assuming user already logged in, his/her JID should be in DB
	* retrieve the JID and password
	* use them to connect to XMPP server
		* store connection object in memory and DB, one connection per account in its own thread
		* when broker restarted, connection should be re-established
	* check subscription table (our own, not axon's one) for existing subscription for this account
		* if exists, create new subscription and store in database again
			* if subscription creation succesful, delete the old subscription
			* else, don't delete, so we can retry next time
	* on notification from Cloud:
		* process notification (source, type, values, etc)
		* if matches trigger condition, notify IFTTT
[ ] deleting subscription
