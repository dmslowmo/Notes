===== Subscription =====

* Need to be careful when subscribing to something as it may not be able to be deleted eg. presence.
* As a result, we keep getting presence updated messages, which will litter our Queue and affect performance
* Subscription 'created' message from Cloud is **different** for '{acc}/{gw}/devices/{obj}' and '/portal/scenes/{id}'
	* in the former, the key is '**path'**, but in the latter is **'id'**
	* this causes hackish workaround, for now
