====== Memory usage investigation ======
Created Wednesday 23 August 2017

* Heap profile after running locally for 5 minutes (app start up test)
	* Epoxy: 
		* Allocated: ~1.5GB
		* Used (max): ~800MB
	* Axon-cloud-service:
		* Allocated: ~700MB
		* Used (max): ~300MB ---> a spike in the beginning
	* ifttt (without subscription module)
		* Allocated: ~1GB
		* Used (max): ~300MB
* **Overall:**
	* Allocated: ~3.2GB
	* Used (max): ~1.4GB

* Heap profile of ifttt with subscription module:
	* Allocated: 1GB+
	* Used (max): 500MB+ (after few minutes, and few subscriptions)

* QUESIONS:
	* should we tune the GC?
		* how aggressive it is, at which % of memory usage should GC be invoked?
	* How much memory used at worst case?
	* How should we code such that memory usage and GC are efficient?
