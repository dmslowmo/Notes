====== 01 Epoxy side ======
Created Tuesday 04 April 2017

===== General Requirements =====
* Implementing new database in Cassandra, with optimized schema from DB Team requires Frontend and API to change.
* Service layer probably needs to change as well.
* The old Load Simulator add-on in Epoxy is to remain intact.

===== General Plan =====

==== Frontend ====
* Copy from current frontend, but do not switch to this frontend yet until the backend is ready
* backend (axon-cloud) should be done first

==== API ====
* Also copy from current one and modify but keep the current one

==== Service ====
* Whole new implementation, but mostly can be copy-pasted, just change "by id" to "by name"
