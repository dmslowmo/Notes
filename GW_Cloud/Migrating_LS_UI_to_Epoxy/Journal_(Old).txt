====== Journal (Old) ======
Created Wednesday 23 November 2016

==== 23/11/2016 ====
1. Able to run LoadSim locally using docker mysql-simulator
2. Wrote the stub Js and HTML for Simulation page
	* Currently still debugging, loadsimulator.js is unable to load

==== 24/11/2016 ====
* Able to get loadsimulator.js loaded, but still can't login
	* net::ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR
	* Cause: in the config.js, the url uses 'https' which would require tomcat server to have self-signed certificate (troublesome)
	* Workaround: for development, just use 'http'
* Able to show Load Simulator internal page, but no content (empty table)
	* REST request returns with error 404
	* Cause: the angular call was JSONP which is not supported by Load Simulator backend
	* Fix: use GET instead and returns response.data

==== 25/11/2016 ====
* Enabled:
	* start simulation
	* copy simulation
	* delete simulation
* Progress has been slow because of unfamiliarity with angularJs
* For faster but dirty results, may be start to create the other 2 tabs (Profiles and Reports)
* Still have logging functionalities!

==== 28/11/2016 ====
* Enable the other tabs:
	* Profiles
		* NEW button
		* Table
		* Clicking 'Name' and 'NEW' button will redirect to a new page
			* and come back to LoadSimulator/Profiles page upon 'OK'/'Save'/'Cancel'
	* Run Reports
		* Clicking 'ID' or 'Name' will redirect to a new page (same one) to show simulation detail
		* and come back to LoadSimulator/RunReports page upon 'OK'/'Save'/'Cancel'
		* Clicking 'down arrow' will expand profile details on the same page
		* Checkbox to filter only running simulations on the page
		* need pagination
* Remaining Simulations tab features:
	* Simulation Details (expand the down arrow icon)
	* Edit simulation
	* NEW simulation button and create new simulation
		* need to redirect to new page to create new simulation
		* and come back to LoadSimulator/<tab> page upon 'OK'/'Save'/'Cancel'
	* Icon not showing
	* find way not to reload whole page for 'copy new simulation'
* PROGRESS: NOTHING WORKED! Wasted one day!

===== 29/11/2016 =====
* Managed to enable all three tabs now
	* Cause for previous failure: didn't realize the return from $http is assynchronous. The command returns a promise. Hence, need the .then() clause to get the data.
		* http://stackoverflow.com/a/32568670
	* Each tab's template is contained in its own .html file
	* Currently all shares 1 controller and service
	* Only showing static data, for Simulation Runs only 1st 10 entries (1st page)
	* Added filter "Show Running Simulations Only"
* Next target:
	* Enable creating NEW Simulations
		* Partially done, missing Profile(s) attachment and input validation
	* Enable creating NEW Profile
		* Partially done, missing Device(s) attachment and input validation
	* Instead of icons, just use buttons for start/edit/clone/delete **[done]**
	* Display Simulation details from clicking '+' or name hyperlink
	* Display Profile details from clicking '+' or name hyperlink
	* Graphic for Simulation Runs

===== 01/12/2016 =====
* Today's goal:
	* NEW Simulations with Profile(s) attachment enabled
	* If relatively easy, do the same for NEW Profile creation
	* Grey out the icons after Simulation starts **[done]**
	* Change Date format to proper format **[done]**
	* "Record Events"
		* Implement this **[done]**

===== 02/12/2016 =====
Goals for today:
[*] NEW Simulations with Profile attachment
[ ] NEW Profile with Device attachment
[ ] Error handling and notification
	[ ] when server not responding (404 etc)
	[ ] When Simulation started
	[ ] when Simulation Stopped
[*] Clear form when exiting Simulation/Profile creation form
[*] Merge to master

===== 05/12/2016 =====
Goals for today:
[ ] Simulation's Profile Detail list on clicking the 'down-arrow' icon (read only)
[ ] Simulation's Detail on clicking the Simulation Name (can edit)
[ ] Edit Simulation (same as above)

===== 06/12/2016 =====
* Found major hole in the Epoxy LoadSimulator: does not work because Epoxy runs on HTTPS in production
	* Since all REST calls are made in Javascript frontend, the browser will block these HTTP calls
	* Need to build the backend which will make the REST calls to LoadSimWeb
	* Frontend just make REST calls to this backend
* TODO:
	* Api classes (split per page). This is the REST end point
		* LoadSimulatorSimulationsApi
		* LoadSimulatorProfilesApi
		* LoadSimulatorSimulationRunsApi
	* Service classes
		* LoadSimulatorSimulationsService
		* LoadSimulatorProfilesService
		* LoadSimulatorSimulationRunsService
	* Model classes. This is for REST calls to the LoadSimWeb
		* LoadSimulatorSimulationsModel
		* LoadSimulatorProfilesModel
		* LoadSimulatorSimulationRunsModel
	* Update EpoxyApiServiceFactory

===== 12/12/2016 =====
* Done backend REST endpoints for those required by current UI only
* integrated Minh UI code, but without my own changes (need to merge the changes manually)

===== 13/12/2016 - 15/12/2016 =====
[ ] Replace the direct frontend $http calls to LoadSimulator with the call to backend
	[*] get all simulations
	[*] start simulation
	[*] copy simulation
	[*] delete simulation
	[*] update simulation
	[*] save simulation
	[*] get all profiles
	[*] copy profile
	[*] delete profile
	[ ] update profile
	[*] save profile
		[*] without devices
		[*] with devices
	[*] get all runs
	[*] stop run
[*] Implement "Update/Edit" Simulation feature
[*] Integrate the drop-down Simulation's Profile list

===== 15/12/2016 - 19/12/2016 =====

[*] Implement security: send token in every request
[*] change the API for get profiles
[*] implement stop simulation button
[ ] implement the chevron icon for showing profile list in Simulation Runs page (same as in simulation)
[*] implement Simulation Runs detail page
	[*] Name, etc (text inputs)
	[*] show graphs features:
		[*] Simulation Monitor Data
		[*] Simulator Cumulative Monitor Data
		[*] System Monitor Data
		[*] System Cumulative Monitor Data
		[*] Simulator State Data
		[*] System State Data
		[*] Probably need to use chartist to be used with angular (angular-chartist). Check whether these are installed:
			[*] angular-chartist.js: https://github.com/paradox41/angular-chartist.js
			[*] chartist angular directives: https://github.com/gruberb/chartistAngularDirective
			[*] how to install for Epoxy?
	[*] Error Log
[ ] Pagination for Simulation Runs page

===== 19/12/2016 =====
[*] REST endpoints:
	[*] Accounts
	[*] gateways
	[*] devices
[*] Create Simulation Run Detail page
	[*] state changes
	[*] display list of accounts, gateways, devices
	[*] Line chart for Running Simulations:
		[*] how is data generated? **REST API ../chart-data/...**
		[*] how is data sent to front-end? **REST API above also**
		[*] learn to display line chart:
			[*] if cannot make this work with real, increasing data by end of the day, just hardcode the data for display first
		[x] **Still missing:**
			[x] seems Chartist does not support tooltip when points are not shown on the line
			[ ] pagination

===== 20/12/2016 - 22/12/2016 =====
[ ] Based on feedback from Christian:
	[*] add Refresh button in Simulation Run page
	[*] give more space at the top and bottom of the checkbox
	[ ] Use uniform style for Simulation and Profile, and the rest of the application
	[*] get rid of the horizontal scrollbars
[*] Massage the chart-data/monitor into the form that Chartist accept
	[*] simulator details
	[*] simulator cumulative details
	[*] system details
	[*] system cumulative details
[*] Simulator Run details page improvement
	[*] shade area under line
	[*] add 'All' option in dropdown lists
	[*] change refresh button to follow other pages
