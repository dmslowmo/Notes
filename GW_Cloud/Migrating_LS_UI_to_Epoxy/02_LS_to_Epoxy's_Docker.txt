====== 02 LS to Epoxy's Docker ======
Created Wednesday 18 January 2017

We need to get rid of the LoadSimWeb container. LoadSimWeb can share the same Tomcat server as Epoxy.
So both of them will be sharing the same Docker container.

===== Preliminary studies =====
1. Need to try how to run 2 projects on the same Docker
2. Need to consider that each running Simulation is a process:
	a. Memory consumption and CPU load when more and more simulations are running
	b. They share the same Cassandra DB as Epoxy
3. Architecture?
