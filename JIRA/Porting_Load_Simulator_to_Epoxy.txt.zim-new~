====== Porting Load Simulator to Epoxy ======
Created Friday 11 November 2016

===== Description =====
To integrate Load Simulator application into Epoxy. The Load Simulator becomes a sub-app of Epoxy and will no longer be accessible directly from web browser.
The Load Simulator itself still runs on its own instance, but accessible through Epoxy.

===== General Requirements =====
* Load Simulator (LS) GUI has to be migrated to Epoxy, probably will need to be re-designed.
	* migrate all the js and mustache files
	* New design:
		* color scheme and layout follows Epoxy (side bars and headers)
		* Top menu links on LS should be changed to Tabs
* The backend of LS is accessed via REST API
	* Need to see if there is already REST API endpoints between LS GUI and Backend
	* If no REST interface in LS, then need to create it and make pull request to Mintdata
	* Need new REST endpoint in Epoxy to access LS
* Epoxy must be able to do the following:
	* track/log the activities on LS
	* takeover the responsibilities of:
		* Profile creation ===> ported from LS
		* Monitoring ===> ported from LS
	* control the access to LS
		* via configuration (mechanism already exists) ===> probably falls under which admin accounts can use it or not
		* if disabled, then user cannot see the link or access it directly via command line
* Database
	* LS uses Mysql for profiles, and Cassandra for the rest
	* May be needed to migrate everything to Cassandra

===== Internal requirements =====
* Write more tests


===== Plan =====
* Familiarize with LS codes
	* Add unit tests (but don't need to create Pull Request)
	* See how UI communicates with
* Migrate UI
	* Create Mock LS to test
* Migrate the features:
	* profile creation
	* monitoring
	* Create Mock LS to test
