===== Hypothesis =====
* some commonly used dependencies accross multiple modules are statically linked, which could be dynamically linked

===== Approach =====
* listing the Makefiles under **proprietary** dir that are relevant to bhr4/bhr4_dev, then grep for "Bstatic"
* list the dependencies that are statically linked
* list the commonly used dependencies and their sizes (calculating possible saving)
* one by one, replace the static linking with dynamic linking
* finalize the list of dependencies that can be dynamically linked rather than statically linked
