====== TR69 Test Harness ======
Created Tuesday 07 June 2016

===== Objective =====
	Create an automated test framework which includes the following functionality:
		Simulate the functions of ACS and support the frequently-used RPC methods.
		Mirror the SSMs on the DUT.
		Compare values in the mirror SSMs with the values SPV/GPV to/from DUT.

===== Architecture =====
{{~/Documents/BHR4/tr69_test_harness/TestHarness_arch.png}}

===== Business Logic =====
1. CWMP client in DUT connects to ACS simulator in TH
2. TH connects to value store observer in DUT
3. Value store observer in DUT synchronizes SSMs value changes to TH in real time. TH stores SSMs in value map.
4. TH parses test plan to test items, then sequentially sends test items to DUT by RPC methods (GPV/SPV/GPA/SPA/...)
5. TH receives test response from DUT and generates test results. If the test item is GPV/SPV, TH compares the parameter values with SSMs value map and generates analysis results.
Notes: TH is independent of data model. For GPV/SPV, test analysis results depend on whether the correct SSMs are synchronized to TH.
