====== BHR2X-157 AlertMap Wildcarded count ======
Created Monday 11 July 2016

[ ] New AlertMap matching type â€” wild-carded count
	[ ] https://greenwavesystems.atlassian.net/browse/BHR2X-157
	[ ] Desigin:
		[ ] Per-client alert for a particular stats, eg PHY rate
		[ ] when alert is raised, update raised-alert list
			[ ] since the polling interval is the same as calculation interval, it is expected that the list contain unique alerts
			[ ] alert, if raised, should occur every 5*n minutes, where n >= 1
		[ ] Poor Aggregate PHY rate (for eg)
			[ ] calculated every 5 minutes
			[ ] calculation: (no. of raised alerts)/(no. of possible alerts) * 100%
			[ ] then reset the count/list of raised alerts
			[ ] Action will be taken when alerts are raised for more than 50% of the clients
				[ ] Action could be resetting the connection, or just logging, etc
			[ ] Need 1 rule, but per-client Alert?
				[ ] NO, it is still 1 Rule object, 1 Alert object, but the rule per client follows a "template rule"

[ ] Todo:
	[ ] Mechanism to create pre-client rule
		[x] Need 'template' rule
		[x] Need to have a SDHL Request type in JSON schema for 'per-client rule'?
			[x] NO
		[*] Or, how do you distinguish per-client rule from normal new rules?
			[*] by its "alertMatchingType" property
			[*] need to create a new alertMatchingType
			[ ] we can assume the ruleID from BHR is already in the [RuleID+MACADDR] form
	[*] Mechanism to take stats of alerts raised pertaining to certain per-client rule
		[*] added //raisedPrefixedWildcardAlerts// map in Monitor class which is a //synchronized// Map
		[*] added methods to add, clear, and get the counts
	[*] I think the per-client rule will be created and used to calculate the aggregate stats
		[*] whereas for individual prefixed, wildcarded rule, it follows normal process
		[*] Therefore, we create special handling for per-client rule:
			[*] if the alertMatchingType is PREFIXED_WILDCARD
			[*] get the counts of the raised PREFIXED_WILDCARD alerts over the last 5 minutes
			[*] and raise the Alert and perform the specified action

[ ] Documentation
	[ ] draw activity diagram using PlantUML to present the design for review

[ ] Testing
	[*] Test individual 'unit'
	[ ] Test the flow
		[*] using unit test
		[ ] using GDT
