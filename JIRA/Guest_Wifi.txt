===== Code Review =====
* GuestSecureNetworkSsm contains the configuration of the Guest secure network
* GuestSecureNetworkSsm is instantiated during the creation of FeatBHR4::FeatureSsms
	* where the maxTotalNoAssociatedDevices is set to default 10
* This Ssm is needed in the creation of the following modules:
	* DhcpServer
	* GuestBl
	* RestApi (taken from FeatureSsms
	* Tr69Bl
* Guest Wifi feature is incomplete:
	* Splash page is not displayed
	* GDT shows guest_network as "off" even when it is enabled via BHR4 UI
* For non-secured Guest network, GuessNetworkSsm is used
	* see guest_wifi_bl.cpp
