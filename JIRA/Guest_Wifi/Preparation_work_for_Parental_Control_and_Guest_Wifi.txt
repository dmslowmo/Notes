====== Preparation work for Parental Control and Guest Wifi ======
Created Monday 20 June 2016

===== Background =====
Leon is urging the design of those to reuse components, and to be more 'Axon-ised'

===== Common functionality =====
Redirect a user to a webpage

===== Timeline =====
* around sep/oct
* hopefully enough time to design and develop in the right way

===== Resource (manpower) =====
From DK:
	Allan Dickow (dedicated, though BHR5 may take his time ad-hoc), Lars Marqvart (80%)

===== Planning =====
Axon router project in Jira (https://greenwavesystems.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?projectKey=AXRO&rapidView=115&view=planning.nodetail)

==== Step 1 ====
Identify EC-APIs, Modules, messaging between them

==== Step 2 ====
* Axon architecture from module perspective.
* Lifecycle management on modules is missing today.
* Rodrigo responsible for module architecture, onboard with this
* Module development and implementation work.... rethink?
* Modules written by: us, Lars, Allan

===== Axon Router challenges: =====
each target platform has different configuration needs / requirements.
e.g. wifi ethernet present / not present.  capabilities different for different chipsets / hardware

===== Others =====
* Andreas PO for parental control
* Bob & Andreas work together on requirements / priorities
* Potentially native modules.  David did some work on module design previously.
* Socket based message router available in Java
* Native message router?
* Lifecycle of the modules
* Discovery of the modules
* Need to be able to deploy modules, register them in the message router.
