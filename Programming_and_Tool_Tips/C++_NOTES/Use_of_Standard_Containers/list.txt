====== list ======
Created Monday 29 February 2016

* Implements a linked list
* Saves the copying when new items are added
	* BUT
		* it++ is an indirection
		* Keeping it sorted? Finding place to insert is a lot of it++ ⇒ lots of traversal ⇒ bad performance
		* Never assume list will be faster
			* measure and see, do it many times, with different sizes
		* Using algorithms means changing containers is pretty easy eg. begin(v) and end(v)
