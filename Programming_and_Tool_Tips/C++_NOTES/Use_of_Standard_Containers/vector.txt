====== vector ======
Created Monday 29 February 2016

* Grows itself when you add new element
* Can traverse with an iterator or random access with []
* Decent performance
* Cleans up after itself
	* even when there is exception
	* eg. try { //some vector creation } catch (std::exception& ex) { }
	* in this example, we didn't do anything to clean up the memory allocated for the vector in the catch block, and we didn't need to
