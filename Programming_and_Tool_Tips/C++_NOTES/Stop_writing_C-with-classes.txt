====== Stop writing C-with-classes ======
Created Monday 14 March 2016

* it must be noted though: just do this when starting a new project
	* existing working code need not be touched
* if you're writing a proof of concept or a demo, even more so
	* //write clean, readable, maintainable code from the beginning//
* look for opportunities to:
	* replace char* with string
		* prevents memory leak as std::string manages its own memory
	* use cout rather than printf (if you ever need to print to console)
	* use modern c++ containers
	* replace #define
	* use std::algorithms to handle loops
		* may involve lambda
	* replace function pointers:
		* virtual functions and inheritance
		* lambdas
		* templates
	* use auto
	* be object-oriented
