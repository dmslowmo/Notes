Continue to work on [[Redmine Issues:BHR4:IPv6 Packet Too Big not sent]]
[*] Learn how to use //tcpdump//
	* To watch the traffic on Raspberry-pi
	* Findings:
		* tcpdump console output shows that on Raspberry-pi, packet>PMTU arrived **unfragmented**
		* however, it replies in 2 fragments (fragmentation at source)
		* So the question is still the same: **Why does BHR4 forward this packet>PMTU rather than sending "packet too big" to the sender??**
[x] If no luck with Raspberry-Pi, try borrowing a laptop
	* with Wireshark on it
	* to be used as a Receiving client
	* and watch incoming/outgoing traffic on it
