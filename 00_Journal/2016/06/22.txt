[*] Read IPTV Design doc
[*] Sprint planning meeting:
	[*] will work on BHR2X-222 https://greenwavesystems.atlassian.net/browse/BHR2X-222: SDHL IPTV: Design mechanism for not discarding samples at calc interval - running average
	[*] will work together with Mostafa
[*] SDHL tips from Kokkee
	[*] use BHR4Simulator to simulate BHR4 process and run it together with SDHL selfHealing process
	[*] mechanisms has changed ie. no longer using config file as param
	[*] so, got jars of BHRSimulator and SelhHealing based on old codes from Kokkee
		[*] tested, but need to fix the properties file in [[/config]] (change to my local paths)
	[*] We can run SDHL in BHR4 router, and enable debug in logging option in /mnt/config
