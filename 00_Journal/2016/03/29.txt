[*] Check how long after startup the MoCA link takes to be up
	[*] Ans: 10-12 secs
[*] Could not make the MoCA be selected without switching to Eth first
	[*] If we decide on whether to switch or not based on Timeout, it will never switch back to Eth
	[*] In this case, it will never re-try MoCA because the condition of 'currentIf' is still 'eth0' ie MoCA
	[*] In any case, the limitation is with the fact that MoCA link does not go up in time before interface selection
[x] Create unit test for the new logic
	[ ] no need, we go back to original Kokkee's logic. The requirements didn't make sense. Eth will be prioritized if both links are up.
[*] IPv6 studies:
	[*] watch up to chap 7
