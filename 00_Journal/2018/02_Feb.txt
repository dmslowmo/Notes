====== 02 Feb ======
Created Tuesday 13 March 2018

===== 21/02/2018 =====
TODO:
[ ] tr69 data model mapping:
	[ ] does it need to be 'readWrite' or 'readOnly' will do?
[ ] finish the mapping

===== 19-20/02/2018 =====
[*] SnapshotBL code review TODO:
	[*] Have 3 status flags/enums:
		[*] p~~rocessStatus: idle/in-progress~~
		[*] lastOperation: passed/failed/none
		[*] snapshotAvailability: ready/none
		[*] last snapshot's timestamp
		[*] processStatus to boolean save_settings_now
	[*] Have a StructValue to contain all snapshot grouped items, then each group will be a member to this StructValue. This is to facilitate value visitor to recursively get the values
		[*] Refactored WirelessSetingsSnapshot to extend StructValue
		[*] Create SnapshotItems, which extends StructValue and have WirelessSettingsSnapshot as Member<>
	[*] Fixed the naming WirelessSnapshot vs WirelessSnapshotSsm and make it consistent

===== 09/02/2018 =====

==== TODO ====
[ ] Create mapping between SnapshotSsm and (autogen) tr69ssm
	[ ] partially done
	[ ] need to complete the rest of the wireless values
[ ] Test the integration from GDT whether snapshot is taken


===== 07-08/02/2018 =====

==== TODO: ====
[*] Create a function which copies the values inside non-copyable WepKeySsm
	[*] get the values inside the WepKeySsm object
	[*] ~~create new WepKeySsm and populate it with the values~~
	[*] ~~Take care to give unique ValueId, different from the original WepKeySsm object~~
[*] Create REST API design

===== 05-06/02/2018 =====

==== TODO: ====
[ ] ~~Design data structure to represent wireless security settings~~
[*] WirelessSettings: Add security-related settigns for each network type
	[*] WEP Authentiation type
	[*] WEP Active Key
	[*] WEP Key (this is an SSM of its own)
	[*] WPA allowed encryption method
	[*] WPA Key
[*] Complete the plumbing in SaveAndRestoreSsm.takeSnapshot()
[*] Relocate the source files in proprietary folder:
	[*] create a new directory named **snapshot_module**
	[*] move the source files there
		[*] need to fix the Makefile(s)
	[*] include the necessary headers in feat_bhr4.cpp
[*] Secondary goals: consider renaming the classes
	[*] SaveAndRestoreSsm ---> SnapshotSsm

===== 02/02/2018 =====
* Plumbing of SaveAndRestoreSsm to featBhr4::Bhr4BusinessLogic
	* Enabled basic plumbing, with wireless settings
	* unit tested the trigger
* TODO:
	* Wireless settings:
		* The password is per SecurityMode
		* Each network (2G/5G/Guest) has 4 possible modes to choose from (need Enum)
		* Each network needs to store password for each possible security mode (need Map)


===== 01/02/2018 =====
* We are not sure where is the TR69 interface which exposes all the wifi modes (2/5G, guest etc)
	* NetWifiBssSSm is the generic Ssm for each mode, we need to find the TR69 one
* Requirement updated to include security mode (WEP/WPA, etc)
* We still do not have a good idea how to map from the frontend (XML mapping) and the backend (Ssm)
